# Exercise 4.1

1. Plausibility, suprises, deviations

See individual ".result" files or run

> make print-results

Most of my results are "pleasently consistent" with those in the
Benchmark paper, however I have a unpleasently high standard deviation
in Mark4. I'm not sure what causes this, and my resulting values are
consistent. I've switched off the obvious interfering processes on my
machine.

2. This is spot on consistent with Mark6 on the same machine

Between machines: TODO
